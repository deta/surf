Welcome to Code Generation in Surf! This is a feature we have been thinking about for a long time, and we are excited to finally share it with you ✨

# 📸 Using Surflets with the Vision Tool

The idea is that you can use anything that you can see as an input to create some very cool interactive little Surflets. Let's pick this table for example:
You can ask it to:

> 'build an interactive chart from that data.'

Use `CMD` / `CTRL` + `Shift` + `1` to open the vision picker to get started.

# 💬 Using Surflets within Sidebar Chat

You can also start generating an Surflet by asking the chat itself. You are also able to save an Surflet in your stuff or directly as a note.

# 📝 Dropping Surflets onto Notes

We think that the most powerful way to use code generation is to drop Surflets onto your notes. This way you can create notes and enrich them with interactive elements.

The solar system example was created with the following prompt:

> 'Build an interactive solar system with threejs.'
